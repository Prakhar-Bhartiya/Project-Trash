# Project-Trash

# Inspiration :
<br>With the increasing population, the problem of waste generation and management is inevitable. With the rise of the fast life in big cities, the monitorization of waste saw its downfall due to a decrease in the number of municipality workers and irregularity of garbage collection trucks. Due to this, an abundance of waste is getting piled up in remote areas that are out of the knowledge scope of the municipality. Since these waste disposals are not treated, they have to lead to the spread of numerous diseases, sanitation, and environmental problems</br>

# Solution :
<br>Once the images are stored in the online storage and its locational coordinates in the real-time database, the images are downloaded and passed on to ResNet 101 CNN architecture, which classifies the garbage present in the image and calculates the amount of the garbage present. the calculated information is updated back in the database. The collective garbage information (volume, type, and location) is then visualized on a heat map.</br>

# Future : 
<br>The next phase of development for us would be the integration of Drones and implementing automated machinery for cleaning and collection purposes thus improving the sanitation standards.</br>
